# programming- project
Joel Lantigua
For this project I will be doing a pong game where two players will play a game sort of like ping pong
This code can be ran on python or even on your mac terminal
this was a simple game of ping pong 
if i had more time to work on this i could of added some sound effects or maybe added different levels to the game
