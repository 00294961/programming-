The first thing i would need to do is get the gameboard and scoreboard up and running
Next i would need to create the two paddles for the players these paddles will be able to move up and down
I will need to assign some keys to allow to paddles to move up and down.
Next i would need to construct to scoring method which will be a ball and if that ball reaches the wall behind the paddle then they score
Next i would need to add some sound effects so the players can actually enjoy the game.
